# Histone Citation Data : Calculating Co-Citation Frequencies
***
## Introduction
The aim of this assignment is to calculate co-citation frequencies of all cited papers that were obtained after matching PubMed journal articles 
data for the search term 'histones' from for the years 1980 to 1990 (both inclusive) with open_citations data as found in Valhalla.<br>
<br>

A csv file containing 'citing' and 'cited' information has been used as a starting point for this assignment.
The following are some key features of this input file:<br>
    1. Total of rows: 87,332 (each row represents a 'citing' - 'cited' pair)<br>
    2. Total number of unique citing papers: 5,008<br>
    3. Total number of unique cited papers: 33,566<br>
    4. There are 5 columns : 'n', 'pmid', pub_year', 'doi', 'cited'<br>
    
    
The code for the analysis can be found in the Jupyter Notebook titled 'HistoneDataAnalysis'.
